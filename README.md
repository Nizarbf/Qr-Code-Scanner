As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any questions regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
